# cuTile Python

cuTile is a parallel programming model for NVIDIA GPUs and a Python-based DSL.
It automatically leverages advanced hardware capabilities, such as tensor cores and tensor memory accelerators,
while providing portability across different NVIDIA GPU architectures.
cuTile enables the latest hardware features without requiring code changes.

cuTile kernels are GPU programs that are executed in parallel on a logical grid of blocks.
The @ct.kernel decorator marks a Python function as a kernel’s entry point.
Kernels cannot be called directly from the host code; the host must queue kernels for execution on GPU
using the ct.launch() function:

```
import cuda.tile as ct
import cupy

TILE_SIZE = 16

# cuTile kernel for adding two dense vectors. It runs in parallel on the GPU.
@ct.kernel
def vector_add_kernel(a, b, result):
    block_id = ct.bid(0)
    a_tile = ct.load(a, index=(block_id,), shape=(TILE_SIZE,))
    b_tile = ct.load(b, index=(block_id,), shape=(TILE_SIZE,))
    result_tile = a_tile + b_tile
    ct.store(result, index=(block_id,), tile=result_tile)

# Host-side function that launches the above kernel.
def vector_add(a: cupy.ndarray, b: cupy.ndarray, result: cupy.ndarray):
    assert a.shape == b.shape == result.shape
    grid = (ct.cdiv(a.shape[0], TILE_SIZE), 1, 1)
    ct.launch(cupy.cuda.get_current_stream(), grid, vector_add_kernel, (a, b, result))
```

Kernels move data between arrays and tiles using functions like
ct.load() and ct.store().
Both arrays and tiles are tensor-like data structures: each has a specific shape
(i.e., the number of elements along each axis) and a dtype (i.e., the data type of elements).
However, there are important differences:

- Arrays are stored in the global memory. They are mutable and have physical, strided
  memory layouts. Within the kernel code, they support only a limited set of operations,
  mostly related to loading and storing data to/from tiles. Various Python objects,
  including PyTorch tensors and CuPy arrays, can be passed as arrays from the host code
  to the kernel via kernel arguments.
- Tiles are immutable values without defined storage that only exist in the kernel code.
  Tile dimensions must be compile-time constants that are powers of two.
  Tiles support a multitude of operations, including elementwise arithmetic,
  matrix multiplication, reduction, shape manipulation, etc.
